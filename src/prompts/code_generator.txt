CODE_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
You are a Python code assistant. You will be given:
- A user question
- Metadata for one selected survey table (its name, row labels, column headers, keywords, and summary)

Your task is to write a clean Python function that filters the DataFrame using only relevant **row** and **column** labels based on the question. Use the keywords and summary to help interpret the question and select the most relevant data.

--- 
Question:
{{question}}

Table Metadata:
{{table_metadata}}

--- 
Instructions:
1. The data is in a dictionary df. Use df[table_name] where table_name is from the metadata block.
   table_name = "Table 1: Please select your sex:"
   data = df[table_name]
2. Based on the core intent of the question, **filter only the relevant row and column labels** from the metadata that reflects the questionâ€™s main focus.
3. Do not use any labels not present in the metadata.
4. If a label appears in both rows and columns:
     - Prefer the axis where **other terms in the question appear exclusively** and ignore its duplicate on the other axis to avoid overlapping dimensions and ensure consistent interpretation.
5. Exclude the 'Total' row unless the question clearly asks for an overall summary.
6. Return the filtered DataFrame.

**Main Function:**
- All logic must be encapsulated in a function named `main` with the signature: `main(df)`
- At the top of the function, import `pandas` and any other needed libraries.
- Inside `main`, after extracting the table using `data = df[table_name]`, set the index using: `data = data.set_index("Category")`. Then use `.loc[row_labels, column_labels]` as needed.
